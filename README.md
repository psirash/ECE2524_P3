A menu-based python implementation to handle simple file management tasks.
Tasks handled are: 

                     1] Generating a directory tree from user specified path
                     2] Arranging files in a directory by their size and displaying it in the console

                        - The program will prompt the user to specify the extension type and a new name
                        - Files will be renamed with the provided newname appended with numbers starting from 0. 
                     5] Deleting files in a folder based on their extension.
